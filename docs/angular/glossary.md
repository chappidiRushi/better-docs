**AfterRender** — A signal-based hook that runs logic after Angular finishes rendering a view.

**Animation Trigger** — A named definition that controls Angular animations on elements.

**Async Pipe** — A built-in pipe that subscribes to observables or promises and returns their latest value.

**Attribute Binding** — Binding values to HTML attributes on an element using Angular binding syntax.

**Binding Collision** — A situation where multiple bindings target the same property and Angular resolves which one takes effect.

**Bootstrap** — The process of initializing and launching an Angular application.

**Change Detection** — The process Angular uses to synchronize application state with the DOM.

**ChangeDetectionStrategy** — A configuration that controls how and when change detection runs.

**Component** — A reusable UI building block consisting of a template, logic, and metadata.

**Computed Signal** — A derived signal whose value is calculated from other signals.

**Content Projection** — The mechanism for inserting parent-provided content into a child component.

**Content Query** — A query used to access projected content inside a component.

**Control Flow** — Template syntax used to conditionally render or repeat content.

**CSS Custom Property** — A CSS variable (prefixed with `--`) used to share dynamic styling values.

**Dependency Injection (DI)** — Angular’s mechanism for providing dependencies to classes.

**Directive** — A class that adds behavior to existing DOM elements or components.

**Effect** — A reactive side-effect that runs when one or more signals change.

**ElementRef** — A wrapper around a native DOM element provided by Angular.

**Environment Injector** — A hierarchical injector used outside component trees.

**Event Binding** — Binding DOM events to component logic using Angular syntax.

**Form Control** — A single input element in Angular forms with value and validation state.

**Guard** — A router hook that controls navigation access.

**Host Binding** — A binding applied directly to a component or directive host element.

**Host Element** — The DOM element on which a component or directive is instantiated.

**Host Listener** — A listener that reacts to events emitted by the host element.

**Hydration** — The process of attaching Angular to server-rendered HTML.

**Input Signal** — A signal used to receive data from a parent component.

**Injector** — A runtime container that resolves and provides dependencies.

**Interpolation** — Displaying expressions in templates using `{{ }}` syntax.

**Lazy Loading** — Loading application features only when they are needed.

**Lifecycle Hook** — A method invoked at specific moments in a component’s lifetime.

**Model Signal** — A signal used for two-way data binding between components.

**Module** — A logical grouping of related Angular features.

**Native Element** — The actual DOM element represented by an Angular abstraction.

**NgClass** — A directive used to dynamically add or remove CSS classes.

**NgContent** — A directive used to project external content into a component.

**NgFor** — A structural directive used to render lists.

**NgIf** — A structural directive used to conditionally include templates.

**NgStyle** — A directive used to dynamically apply inline styles.

**NgTemplate** — A template fragment that can be rendered dynamically.

**One-Way Binding** — Data flow from component to view or parent to child.

**Output Signal** — A signal used to emit data from a child to a parent component.

**Pipe** — A transformation function used in templates.

**Platform** — The runtime environment where an Angular application executes.

**Property Binding** — Binding component state to DOM properties.

**Provider** — A configuration that defines how a dependency is created.

**Reactive Forms** — A form model driven by explicit state and validation logic.

**Renderer** — An abstraction for safely manipulating the DOM.

**Resolver** — A router feature that preloads data before route activation.

**Routing** — Navigation between views based on URL state.

**Selector** — A string that identifies elements for components or directives.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** — Rendering Angular applications on the server.

**Signal** — A reactive primitive representing a mutable piece of state.

**Standalone Component** — A component that does not require declaration in an NgModule.

**Structural Directive** — A directive that modifies the DOM structure.

**Style Encapsulation** — Angular’s mechanism for scoping component styles.

**Template** — The HTML that defines a component’s view.

**Template Outlet** — A directive used to render templates dynamically.

**TrackBy Function** — A function that optimizes list rendering by tracking item identity.

**Two-Way Binding** — A binding pattern that syncs data in both directions.

**View Child** — A query that accesses elements in a component’s own view.

**View Encapsulation** — The strategy Angular uses to apply component styles.

**View Query** — A query used to access elements inside a component’s template.

**Zone** — An execution context that Angular traditionally uses to trigger change detection.

**Zone-less Change Detection** — Change detection performed without relying on Zone.js.
